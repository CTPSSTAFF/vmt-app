		<h2>Boston Region MPO Vehicle-Miles Traveled and Emissions Data Browser</h2>
		<h3>Introduction </h3>
		<p>You may use this application to browse Central Transportation Planning Staff’s (CTPS) database of 
			modeled vehicle-miles traveled (VMT), vehicle-hours traveled (VHT), and emissions data for the 101 
			cities and towns in the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO). The data are for 
			the 2012 base year, 2020 future year and 2040 future year. CTPS modeled these data for the publication,
			Charting Progress to 2040, which is the current Long-Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) for the Boston 
			region. The future-year scenarios include proposed key regional transportation projects identified in 
			the plan (see 
			<a href="http://www.ctps.org/data/pdf/plans/lrtp/charting/2040_LRTP_Chapter5_final.pdf"/>
				http://www.ctps.org/data/pdf/plans/lrtp/charting/2040_LRTP_Chapter5_final.pdf
			</a>
			,pages 5-11 to 5-13). These data are presented by vehicle type (single-occupancy vehicles, high-occupancy
			vehicles, and trucks) and by time period (6:00 AM to 9:00 AM, 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, 
			and 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM). The definitions of single- and high-occupancy vehicles are self-evident. The 
			truck category includes commercial trucks of many types, such as trailer trucks, hazardous materials 
			trucks, and box trucks; but it does not include passenger pickups and sports utility vehicles (SUV), 
			which would fall under the single- and high-occupancy vehicle categories. 
		</p>
		<p>The emissions data for 2009 that previously was posted on this website was for the base year of the prior 
			LRTP, Paths to a Sustainable Region. The MPO adopts new LRTPs every four years; and in some cases, emissions 
			data for the latest LRTP is drastically different from the data in the previously published plan. These 
			differences are based on a couple of factors. The base year data are different simply because they pertain to 
			travel from different base years—2012 versus 2009. More significantly though, the software used to estimate 
			mobile emissions has changed. The previous plan employed a software program known as MOBILE, while the latest 
			plan uses a program called MOVES. These programs have resulted in significantly different—and improved—emissions 
			estimates.  
		</p>
		<p>You may download the data in a comma-separated values (CSV) format, which popular spreadsheet programs, 
			such as Microsoft Excel and Apache Open Office Calc, can read.
		</p>
		<h3>Using the Application</h3>
		<p>This application allows you to query and display data in five ways:
			<ol>
				<li>
					You may get VMT, VHT, and emissions data for a particular town or city by selecting a municipality in 
					the “Select a Municipality” combo box. The selected municipality is outlined in red on the map, and 
					the data for it is displayed in the tabbed panel on the right side of the application window.
				</li>
				<li>
					You also may obtain VMT, VHT, and emissions data for a particular town or city by clicking on a 
					municipality within the map. The selected municipality is outlined in red on the map, and the data 
					for it is displayed in the tabbed panel on the right side of the application window.
				</li>
				<li>
					You may display the map’s theme by selecting a theme (such as vehicle-miles traveled) from the 
					“Select Map Theme” combo box.
				</li>
				<li>
					You also may display the map’s theme by changing the tabbed panel on the right side of the application 
					window. Switching tabs displays the panel’s selected theme (such as vehicle-miles traveled).
				</li>
				<li>
					You may change the year of modeled data displayed by selecting a year from the “Display Year” combo box. 
					The available years are the 2012 base year, 2020 future year, and 2040 future year, with the 2012 base 
					year as the default.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>Data Sources</h3>
		<p>The data displayed by this application come from:
			<ol>
				<li>Central Transportation Planning Staff of the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization</li>
				<li>Massachusetts Office of Geographic Information (MassGIS)</li>	  
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>Description of Database Fields</h3>
		<p>When the data is downloaded as a CSV file, it contains 80 columns (fields). The meaning of the data in 
			these fields is displayed below:
